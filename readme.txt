#About DT's Debugger

This plugin was created to speed up SEO and Social Media testing via public tools provided by Google, W3C, and Facebook. 

DT's Debugger does **not** allow you to change any meta titles, keywords, open graph data, etc. It is only providing quick-links to debug the existing data and values set for those fields by other 3rd-party SEO plugins, or to test your general page speed and HTML validity.
